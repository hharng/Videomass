# Known problems and solutions
-------------------------------------------

## Using YouTube Downloader

- Stopping a download by clicking the "Abort" button is currently not possible as 
this feature is not yet implemented in the yt-dlp [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). 
Instead, only subsequent downloads in a list of URLs can be stopped.  

- [Drag-and-drop of text and URLs not working with Firefox under Linux](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/issues/17694). 
Using a web browser other than Firefox or dragging and dropping text from a text 
editor seems to work fine. Please note that this issue is related to Videomass 
v4.0.11 and affect Linux OS only.
