Videomass is [free (libre) software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software); it needs your contribution!
There are several ways to help the development of Videomass:

I'd love to get a little sponsorship for the time and effort spent on my projects.

at [Videomass Issues page](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/issues) or email me at <jeanlucperni@gmail.com>

## Packaging
{: .bg-green-300}

A list of Videomass installation packages for Linux is available 
[here](Pages/Packages/Linux). Packaging for other distros still needs to be done. 
Also, I would be very glad if anyone can push Videomass into the official or 
unofficial repositories of any distribution.

## Writing Documentation
{: .bg-green-300}

User documentation of Videomass is still a work in progress. The source files 
are hosted on [github](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/tree/gh-pages/User-guide). 
You can contribute to its content by sending pull requests on GitHub or by 
email <jeanlucperni@gmail.com> .
