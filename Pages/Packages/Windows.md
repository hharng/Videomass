# MS Windows

### Notice for MSWindows owners
{: .bg-red-300}

At the moment I have not been able to create the installers for MS Windows due to 
various problems that occurred during the building of the package using pyinstaller, 
therefore the distribution of new versions of Videomass into stand-alone executables 
is suspended for now.

If you are interested in installing Videomass on MSWindows, please follow this 
installation method:

* [PyPi package](Python_Package) 

Also, if you're interested in how to start videomass using the source code, look [here](Source_Code).

## Old executables

Minimum requirements:
- [Microsoft Windows 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-7)
- [x86_64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) architecture. 
  
[Videomass 5.0.2 Portable](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/releases/download/v5.0.2/Videomass-v5.0.2_x86_64-portable.7z){: .btn .btn-green .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2} 
[All Versions](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/releases){: .btn .btn-green .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2}     

### Warning
{: .bg-red-300}

A lot of antivirus vendors detect **Videomass installer** and **Videomass portable edition** 
as malicious. Since these are false positives, to resolve this problem the only thing 
to do is to submit the Videomass.exe file to your antivirus vendor for advanced 
analysis and making a False Positive claim. 

Alternatively, following this installation method: 

* [PyPi package](Python_Package) 

For any other application-related issues, please read 
[Known Problems](../../known_problems) and [Bug Reports](../Bugs) pages.
