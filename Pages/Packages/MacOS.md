# MacOS

### Notice for MacOs owners
{: .bg-red-300}


Since [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller), 
the cross-platform packager used to create Videomass.App, no 
longer provides support for versions lower than macOS 10.15 (Catalina), my ability 
to continue distributing updated Apps for macOS has [ceased](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/issues/165).

Alternatively, if you own a macOS and are interested in installing Videomass, 
you can follow this installation method:

* [PyPi package](Python_Package) 

Also, if you're interested in how to start videomass using the source code, look [here](Source_Code).
