---   

Videomass is a multifunctional, multitasking front-end for [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and 
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), it was designed for people who need 
a GUI to collect custom presets and profiles and to facilitate the application 
of specific video and audio filters or automate the conversion/transcoding 
processes even in batch mode. 

It features graphical tools for viewing, analyzing, filtering and processing multimedia 
streams with the additional ability to downloading audio/videos via 
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).  

Videomass is [Free (libre) Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), 
created and maintained by [Gianluca (jeanslack) Pernigotto](https://github.com/jeanslack); 
it was written in [Python3](https://www.python.org/) using the 
[wxPython4](https://www.wxpython.org/) toolkit; it is cross-platform and works on 
Linux, MacOs, Windows and FreeBSD.   

The Videomass logo and artwork were created by [Gianluca (jeanslack) Pernigotto](https://github.com/jeanslack)
