# What is Videomass?

---

Videomass is a GUI designed for [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) 
enthusiasts, who need to manage custom profiles to automate conversion/transcoding 
processes even with multiple files in series (batch processing).      

It is based on an advanced use of presets and profiles in order to use most of 
the [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) commands without limits of 
[formats](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html) and 
[codecs](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-codecs.html).   

It features graphical tools for viewing, analyzing and processing multimedia 
streams and downloading videos via [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) 
and/or [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).  

Videomass is [Free (libre) Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), 
created and maintained by [Gianluca Pernigotto (jeanslack)](https://github.com/jeanslack); 
it was written in [Python3](https://www.python.org/) using the 
[wxPython4](https://www.wxpython.org/) toolkit; it is cross-platform and works on 
Linux, MacOs, Windows and FreeBSD.   

Videomass Logo and related artworks are created by Gianluca Pernigotto 
(jeanslack) and by [KDE/Breeze Icons](https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons).

## What is youtube-dl?

[youtube_dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) is a command-line program to
download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites 
(actually, the list is [long](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)). 
It requires the Python interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, and it is not 
platform specific. It should work on your Unix box, on Windows or on macOS. It 
is released to the public domain, which means you can modify it, redistribute 
it or use it however you like.

## What is yt-dlp?

focus of this project is adding new features and patches while also keeping up 
to date with the original project. The project development page can be found
